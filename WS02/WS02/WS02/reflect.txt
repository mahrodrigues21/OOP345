Hello, Professor! In this workshop, I felt more comfortable in do my task. All information that I needed you gave me. My problem is this WS was to know the new library, at least for me the chrono. I read some materials on websites (cplusplus.com and geeksforgeeks.org) to clarify how this library works, and if I need to initialize these members because I always got this error message "x member is uninitialized". In StringSet, I had a problem with my move constructor, I don't know why. I did the same as you did in the lecture of week3, but when the program called the move constructor, the program broke and appear an xstring file saying about CopyAssig. Then I read again the notes chapter Classes and Scoped Enumerations, and copy the example of move constructor, using the std::move. I also had a problem in my for loop using type auto and the type size_t for the member, this problem just shows me when I was submitting that, on VS it worked perfectly. I watched the first lecture when you taught about types, and changed auto = 0 to auto =0u. To this WS I used some lasts WS as examples of my last term, to remember some features as read a file.
