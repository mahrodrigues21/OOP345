My big deal with programming is interpreted the tasks and translate them into a programming language. In this WS I spent so much time figuring out what I need to do. In the previous term, the documentation said at least what member function I needed to create. Futher, I'm not sure if my solution is correct, but it's working, with a little memory leak, but so far I can`t discover what going wrong, I delete and initialized with nullptr all of my char* variables. Where I spent much time was: In main.cpp, "case 'A' ", there is a copy of the current event to archive, that's why I built the copy's member. First at all, I built the Event& operator=(const Event& copy), to pass the object to the "archive". After that my program started breaking on when the program was reading the "Browser closed" line. In this reading, the object didn't return in the status nullptr, after calls the destructor, but in the previous line it was, this is my doubt. Then, I built the Event(const Event& copy) to copies an object to another, for me this member function is not really necessary, but I couldn't find a better solution. I created a variable in the display member function as static, it allows the counter doesn't reinitialize to each call. Also, in this WS we needed to declare an external variable that event.cpp file and main.cpp file can access it. For that, it is necessary to declare on .h file and just declare on the same name .cpp file.PS.: The output of the errors is hard to understand what is going wrong. My problem was the wrong space to list the activities on the day, but the output simply does not print the line, print the hole blank line and does not my "space" and then my output. It was impossible to compare my output and the prof output.
