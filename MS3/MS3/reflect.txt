This assignment was super hard and complicated, mainly the third party I did, I not 100% of the solution or the design is good, but I did. I'm a little more comfortable with vector and STL library. I`m not pretty sure about deque, for me is similar to vector, a container of elements that no matter their length, it's possible to add and remove anytime. So, deque reminded me of JS, where you use the "push" to add information into an array. I think this library is very interesting and has less code. Don't you need to "resize" an array to add information, or take care of memory leak. At least I don't care about it when I tested on Valgrind. I suffered in this project, I almost gave up on the course, but today I have the feeling of accomplishment.I learned much from this project as well. As you mentioned, how much more I write a code more familiar and easier it will be.
