Hello Professor! This WS08 wasn't complicated. I guess I saw this material on OOP245 about smart pointers. The smart pointer is a "feature" on C++ that allows programmers don't need to worry about memory leaks and stuff like that. The code (definition and implementation) to overload a smart pointer or raw pointer doesn't change. They look similar, just the parameter in the function changing to indicate it is a smart pointer or not. But, when it is necessary to create a new object smart pointer is super helpful. After the new object is created, it is not needed to deallocate memory used to this new object (delete matchProd and matchProd = nullptr in my program is just used on raw pointer). My problem in this WS and also in MS02 was attention. I was focused on matching all requirements and completing the task that I simply made many mistakes in the for loop. =/
