Lambda is a function that it is possible to declare and define below the main. It is "compact", with a few lines of code. I used it to change the price of books depending on their country. You can write the lambda code and calls wherever you want below the main.
In Movie and Book class there is a repetition of code where needs to import an archive. It could be designed on the Collection.h template, and both archives need to be the order of the same columns. In my code for WS05 I didn't implement the default constructor, because on my declaration I also define the members function.
In this WS05 I had trouble on Collection.h, works with the template is a recently learned in this course. And also to work on errors. I also had trouble on SpellChecker::operator()(std::string& text), the variable m_counter was crashing. I searched on the website to figure out what was my error. In my while looping, I need to use more string functions like size() and npos. And of course, lambda was harder to write on this WS.
