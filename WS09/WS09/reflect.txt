This WS was terrible, I could study clearly what I did in  this WS I just wrote as requirement. I'm really exhausted about the MS03 and other stuff at this period of final exams. I know this is part of my progress in the program. So, I didn't understand why I need to use the bind here, I saw many examples on "google", I think that I understoond the concept, but why I needed to use it here, I'm not sure. The bind is kind of "mask", you have a function but you don't want to use all parameters that this function has. Bind() allows you to use this function without give all parameters.To finish this WS I received helps for a group of student on dicord. Under fstream, we can use the ios::binary to translate the text understood to humans into bynary version, where only computers can read it.
