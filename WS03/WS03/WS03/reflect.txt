Hello, Professor! Work with the template is not too hard, but as you mention is easier to lose some information and start stuck on what is needed to do. I have a little issue in this WS, one of those was the static class variable definition, as I asked for you and then I was going to discover why the static class variable is defined outside of the class. Another issue was the definition of functions. In many (almost all), I forget to write PairSummable<v, K>, for example, on parameters function. My biggest issue was lack of attention, all my program was running right but the output didn't show information, I spent 2 days figuring out what was my fault. In Set.get I was returning m_arrSet[m_noElement] and not m_arrSet[idx]. I'm very frustrated and exhausted with my error.
The template is very useful to avoid ode repetition. You write a code that the program can use for all types or conditions for parameters. The template does not have .cpp file, because it is a pattern, that compiler uses. The compiler check onli the .h file to see the declaration and definition of the pattern.
const V& value = initial means a default initialization of the value.
The specialization of string type is realized because this function creates a new pattern, to shows the V value separate by a comma. Using specialization we can create many types of patterns for each data type parameter.
Is necessary to initialize the static variable outside of the class, because the compiler needs to allocate memory for it, after the object creation.
